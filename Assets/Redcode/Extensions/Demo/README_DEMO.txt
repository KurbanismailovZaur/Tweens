The Scenes folder contains 4 demo scenes.

The ChangingVectorComponent demo scene consists of some objects and the ChangingVectorComponent script. 
This script uses the WithY extension method on the cube position to set the Y-axis position to 0.
The script also uses the SetPositionXZ method, which sets the values passed to it to the X and Z components of the position vector, respectively.
This allows you to reduce a few lines of code. 

The DestroyChildsWhere demo scene contains a script that shows how you can quickly delete game objects by a certain condition. 
It also allows us to cut a few lines of code.

The GettingComponentsXZ demo scene shows us how to use the GetXZ method on a 3D vector to retrieve a 2D vector containing the values of the X and Z components.

The SettingPositionX demo scene demonstrates how you can easily and quickly set the X-axis value to a game object position.

These are all just examples of use, please read the main documentation for a deeper understanding.
